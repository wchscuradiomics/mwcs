% Compute the boundaries of COEFFS.
% B = boundaries(COEFFS,absolution)
% 
%  COEFFS: a n*m cell of coefficient matrices, where n is the sample size and a row vector contains m
%  coefficient matrices for a sample.
% 
%  absolution: a logical value specifying whether absolute coefficients are used.
% 
%  B: a 2*m matrix representing the boundaries of m components, where the j-th column represents the
%  boundary of the j-th component.
