% Calculate co-occurrence matrices of D and M. Two gradients of direction and magnitude can be
% calculated on an image by the function imgradient.
% 
%  D: a matrix representing the direction gradient.
% 
%  M: a matrix representing the magnitude gradient.
% 
%  nLevels: an integer specifying the number of gray levels to use when scaling the grayscale values
%  in D and M.
% 
%  d: an integer specifying a distance.
% 
%  DCMS: direction gradient co-occurrence matrices, no normalization.
% 
%  MCMS: magnitude gradient co-occurrence matrices, no normalization.
