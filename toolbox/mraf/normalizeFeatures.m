% Normalize features: individually subtract the mean of each feature and divide their respective standard deviations
% [Features,means,stds] = normalizeFeatures(F,means,stds)
% 
%  F: original features that a row vector represents a sample
%  means: specifiy means (a row vector)
%  stds: specify standard devations (a row vector)
