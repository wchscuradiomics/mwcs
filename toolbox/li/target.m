% Create a column vector representing targets (class names). The targets are 1, 2, 3 or a, b, c.
% c = target(names,num1,num2,num3)
% 
%  num1: a interger number representing the sample size of class 1.
% 
%  num2: a interger number representing the sample size of class 2.
% 
%  num3: a interger number representing the sample size of class 3.
% 
%  c: a column vector of n*1 representing the targets (class names) of these n samples.
